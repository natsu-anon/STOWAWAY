0. HASH FINGERPRINTS -- THAT'S YOUR ZK SNARK
1. you can serialize the armored keys just fine & then you can use openpgp.key.readArmored to reconstruct the key objects from public & private armored keys
2. if you want to be able to read your own message you have to pass your own public key
3. keys resultant from revocation have matching fingerprints -- use this to facilitate key revocation p2p
	i.e. if a new public key offered CONTAINS the proper revoked key with a good fingerprint automagically UPDATE that shit fam
	- NOTA BENE: supply the revoked private key bruh
4. Public keys get too big (because of signatures) you'll have to send them as files
